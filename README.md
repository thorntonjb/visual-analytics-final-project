# Visual Analytics Final Project - Technical Report
## Global Energy Consumption: A Comparative and Predictive Analysis

Our project focuses on the Global Growth of Energy Usage and Types. Energy use is a big issue everywhere, and it's important for people to know how much they use. Developed countries often have more energy, but they should use it wisely and think about the future. Leaders and government officials need to keep checking how much energy their countries use, and the information we collect can help them make smart choices.

## We used datasets that are about:
  - Energy use per person over time
  - Country populations
  - Types of energy used worldwide

## For this project, we want to answer questions like:
  - How has energy use changed in the last 50 years?
  - Which countries use the most or least energy?
  - Do rich and poor countries use different types of energy?
